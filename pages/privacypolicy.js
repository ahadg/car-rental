         We collect information from you, directly and through third parties, in accordance with this Privacy Notice any time you contact us, interact with us, or use our website, App, products or services.

         <ul>
             <li>Some of the information we collect can personally identify you, including, for example, your name and contact information, birthdate, government identification, payment information, membership ID, program ID, whether you are a part of a corporate or rewards program, payment arrangements, insurance arrangements, and information related to your rentals or use of products or services we provide or enable. For example, when you make a reservation, or join one of our programs, we collect your personal information such as: your name and contact information; birthdate; driver license and other appropriate government identification; payment information, including credit or debit card information (we collect security codes when you make a payment, but we do not keep them); information to process your discounts, such as coupons, discount codes, and membership numbers or codes; and other information that may be necessary to rent you a vehicle, provide you with services, contact you about these services or verify your identity. If you participate in an insurance program through us or are involved in an accident or property damage, we may collect additional information about your insurance provider and/or coverage.</li>
             <li>We may record or monitor any call you make to us for quality control, to enforce our rights, or for training or similar purposes. We may collect photos and videos in some instances, such as when you choose to share them with us on social media or when we receive a notice of a traffic violation that includes a picture or video. Our rental locations may also be equipped with cameras and/or video security surveillance systems.</li>
             <li>When you download, visit or use our websites or Apps or interact with us using e-mail, texts or other forms of electronic communication, we may we use cookies, pixel tags, beacons, scripts and similar technologies to automatically collect certain information, including, for example, your IP addresses, MAC addresses, device identifier, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), location, how you interact with our websites and/or Apps, referral/exit sites, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</li>

         <br/>
         <ul>
             <li>Some of our rental vehicles are connected cars. A connected car is a vehicle equipped with features, telematics systems, on-board devices, or built-in services and technologies that are capable of collecting data about the vehicle and its use, including, for example, the vehicle’s condition, damage and accident events and records, performance, operation and diagnostic data, information on mileage, acceleration, braking, speed, fuel consumption, fuel level, tire pressure, odometer, location and direction, and other vehicle-related information (collectively, “<span style={{fontWeight:"800", }}>Connected Car Data</span>” or “<span style={{fontWeight:"800", }}>Vehicle Data</span>”). Typically, this information is associated with the vehicle only and maintained as non-personal information, as described in the Non-Personal Information section below. If we link this information to you, we will treat it as personal information.</li>
             <li>Use of features and built-in services and technologies in connected cars are subject to the terms and conditions posted by the vehicle manufacturer and/or the technology provider, which may include system and service limitations, warranty exclusions, limitations of liability, wireless service provider terms, and user responsibilities. Some or all of these features are turned on at all times, even when other services or other media in the vehicle are turned off. If you are unsure whether your rental vehicle is a connected car, please speak to a member of our team at the rental location or contact the Rental Station Manager. Details on the connected car features in our rental vehicles are also set out in the “Vehicle Details” section of the Rental Agreement. We cannot guarantee that a vehicle without connected car features will be available at your time of rental.</li>
             <li>Depending on the technology used in your rental vehicle, vehicle manufacturers and built-in services such as ‘Apple CarPlay’ or ‘OnStar’ may also collect Connected Car Data or other personal information from the vehicle pursuant to their privacy policies. For more information about this third party information collection, please refer to the Third Party Collection section below.</li>

You may opt out of our collection of information about your location from mobile devices at any time by turning off transmission of geolocation data and push notifications on your mobile device.</li>

This Privacy Notice does not apply to non-personal information, which we collect, use and disclose for a variety of purposes.

We also use analytic software, such as Google Analytics and others, to help us to better understand how our websites and Apps function on your device and for research and development. We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, which uses third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the services. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ and you can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On, at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.

We may use third party platforms to help us promote interest-based advertisements to you or to offer integration with third-party services (such as the Facebook Like button). These providers use cookies or similar tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our websites, including our mobile apps, over time so that they may deliver the integrated services or play or display ads on our services, on other websites, apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed email address or user ID) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and our third-party partners use this information to facilitate integrated services or to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. You have options when it comes to cookies and other web tracking tools.
<br/>
<br/>
You can set your browser or device to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features or services may not function properly without cookies. Some browsers support a “Do Not Track” feature, which is intended to be a signal to websites that you do not wish to be tracked across different websites you visit. Our websites do not currently change the way they operate based upon detection of a Do Not Track or similar signal. As the internet and other e-commerce channels continue to develop, we may deploy and utilize different types of technologies to collect data regarding your visit or usage.
<br/>
<br/>
We use information about your location (including, at times, by linking personal information with location information of the rental vehicle you are using) primarily to locate our nearest rental location, send you location-based notifications (i.e., nearby special offers), arrival and return notifications, vehicle location, and upgrade availabilities. We also use information about your location for the same purposes we use your personal information, including to provide you with, and improve, relevant marketing or offers from us and our partners.

         We may retain your information for as long as you have an account with Agile, as needed to provide you our services, or as otherwise necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was originally collected and any other legitimate business purpose, including, for legal, archival, accounting, and/or audit purposes. If you close your account or request we provide you our services, we may retain your information because we have a legal, auditing or account obligations or it is in our archive system and cannot be separated from other information.

         <br/>
         <br/>
         To facilitate the uses of personal information identified in this Privacy Notice, we may share your personal information with a variety of third parties, including our service partners and business partners.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers and partners to help us with our marketing and promotional projects, such as managing our social media pages, running contests, sweepstakes and other promotions, or to comply with your directions or any additional consent you have provided us.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In addition, Agile may share your personal information with third parties who use this information to provide you with information and marketing messages about products or services that may interest you. These parties may use your information in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         If you are renting with a corporate, membership or other similar commercial entity account, we may share personal information with the organization that manages the account for their own purposes. We recommend you review their privacy policy to learn more about their privacy practices.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We and our business and promotional partners send you information about products and services you may like. For example, we may help to arrange hotel rentals, flights or other services from our business partners, and share personal information with our business partners in order to provide those services and facilitate your reservations. We may also work with third parties, such as our airline and payment card partners, to allow us and our partners to deliver advertisements to our shared customers. Our partners may be able to provide more relevant offers to you based upon information that we share about your rentals, as well as information in your loyalty program profile. Additionally, we may allow third-party partners to recognize you when you visit that partner’s website or app, or to recognize you as one of their customers when you visit our websites or apps so that they may provide more relevant offers to you. You may revoke your consent to receive marketing and promotional e-mails and text messages from us and our business and promotional partners. Please note that revoking consent to receive marketing and promotional e-mails and text messages does not affect our non-promotional or non-marketing communications, including, for example, communications about the status and activities of your accounts, billing communications, responses to your requests, post-service feedback or survey requests, confirmations, and similar communications.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We may share website usage information, including searches, transaction and profile information (but not your name) with our partners for the purpose of making the online advertisements on our websites and other websites that display our advertisements more relevant.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We may also let you share some of our online content on social media websites through hosted sharing links and icons. We do not track or store a record of each time a third party shares our online content. If you choose to participate in posting or sharing activities, you should remember that it may be viewed by the public via ABG’s website, in RSS feeds, APIs (application program interfaces) and may also be made available to other websites. As a result, your public activities may appear on third-party websites, blogs, or feeds. ABG is not responsible for the information that may be shared publicly. Our websites may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie so that the Like button feature works properly. Any social media feature is governed by the privacy policies of the website providing the feature. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any website you visit.
