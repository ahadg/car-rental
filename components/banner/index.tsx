                            <li><p>Located in the Caribbean Sea chain of the United States Virgin Islands, St. Thomas is a beautiful tropical destination for travelers with a taste for adventure. Renting a car in St. Thomas is one of the best ways to see the whole island, at your own pace. Charlotte Amalie, Saint Thomas has some of the district's top attractions since St. Thomas is home to several natural bays and historical sites, including Magens Bay, Brewers Bay, and Fort Christian. With Cyril E King Airport being an extremely hilly seven miles from Magen's Bay, a rental car from Agile is ideal for the territory. Securing a rental car from Agile Car Rentals is the way to go if you want to tour Saint Thomas or Saint John.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Finding the right economy rent a car to navigate the Island of St. Thomas, from Cyril E King Airport to the local beaches, resorts, and your Airbnb is essential in Charlotte Amalie. Agile Car Rental has the best deals in St. Thomas. Of all the St. Thomas car rental companies, you want a team that is agile enough to work with you and accommodate to your specific needs. Thatâ€™s where Agile Car Rentals steps in.

                            <li><p>While we encourage you to enjoy all that St. Thomas has to offer, please be mindful of traffic laws. When driving your car rental in the Virgin Islands, observe the laws in place. Charlotte Amalie, Christiansted, Frederiksted, and Coral Bay all follow the same traffic laws that  should be adhered to avoid accidents or  trouble with the police. For instance, when you spot a school, see a senior crossing the road, or notice a handicapped bus stopped to pick up and drop off passengers, you should not overtake it. Driving a car rental can get you almost anywhere on the island, but breaking the traffic laws might stop you from enjoying your rental car experience.</p></li>
