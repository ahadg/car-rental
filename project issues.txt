while we wait do you want me to point out exactly where the problem is?
ok sir 

this is what i want to populate... now im going to show where it is supposed to populate from

all ready for you :-)

gotcha

on the left where it says "0$/hour".. this component is not populating
ok
its called "car-card", the component... 


on the right is where i belive the component to be poplating the json objects and where i;ll need your expertise


literally line 24 where you see the "cars" variable thats being mapped to the UI.

are you following? 
yes 

on this page is what i'd like to populate the car-card component.

this is all i really want done. the disconnect is I don't understand redux well enough to fix this problem at the moment
and hopefully where you can fill the gap.
